"""Self-maintaining coverage contract for the desktop-session guard (#912).

``#885`` wired the desktop-session pre-flight check onto the CLI commands and
MCP tools that obtain the Windows UI backend, so they fail loudly instead of
returning fabricated success (empty arrays, all-black PNGs, stale window lists)
in a ``NO_DESKTOP_SESSION`` environment.  ``tests/test_no_desktop_guard_885.py``
locks that down with a *behavioral* matrix that proves a representative set of
those surfaces fails loudly.

That matrix is a hand-maintained static list, however, and nothing forces a
*future* CLI subcommand or MCP tool to either carry the guard or be a
deliberate, reviewed exemption.  The moment someone adds a new backend-touching
surface without the guard, the ``#885`` silent-failure class can silently recur
there while every existing test stays green -- because the new surface simply
isn't in any list.

This module closes that hole.  It derives the surface inventory **at runtime**
and asserts every surface is classified into exactly one of two explicit,
reviewed sets:

* ``_CLI_DESKTOP_SESSION_REQUIRED`` / ``_MCP_DESKTOP_SESSION_REQUIRED`` --
  surfaces that acquire the desktop UI backend and therefore *must* fail loudly
  without an interactive desktop session (the ``require_desktop_session`` /
  guarded ``_get_backend`` class).
* ``_CLI_SESSION_INDEPENDENT`` / ``_MCP_SESSION_INDEPENDENT`` -- surfaces that
  do **not** touch the desktop UI backend and work headless: pure config,
  clipboard text, on-disk selector / visual-baseline / recording / snapshot
  stores, snapshot diffing of stored data, Chromium/CDP browser automation,
  Excel COM automation, MCP/daemon management, and pure ``--help``.

A brand-new surface that is in neither set fails
:func:`test_every_cli_leaf_is_classified` /
:func:`test_every_mcp_tool_is_classified`, forcing its author to make a
conscious decision: route it through the guard and add it to the
desktop-required set (and the behavioral matrix), or justify it as
session-independent.  This converts the ``#885`` static snapshot into a
self-maintaining contract -- guard coverage can no longer silently rot as the
CLI/MCP surface grows.

The classification was grounded in the source, not guessed: a surface is
desktop-required iff its handler reaches ``naturo.backends.base.get_backend``
(directly or through the guarded ``_get_backend``).  Two deliberate notes:

* ``clipboard`` is split by surface because the two entry points differ today:
  the MCP ``clipboard_*`` tools route through the guarded ``_get_backend`` (so
  they fail loudly and are desktop-required), while the ``clipboard`` *CLI*
  commands use a local backend accessor that does not run the desktop-session
  pre-flight -- consistent with ``#885`` listing "pure-clipboard" as a
  session-independent allow-list example.  The sets record actual behavior, not
  aspiration.
* ``diff`` and the ``desktop`` (virtual-desktop) commands acquire the backend
  via a raw ``get_backend()`` rather than the guarded helper; they are
  classified desktop-required because they genuinely need a session.  Hardening
  their acquisition to the guarded path is tracked separately and is out of
  scope for this coverage test.

Relates to #912.  Regression-proofs #885 / #868 / #875 / #878 / #883 / #893.
