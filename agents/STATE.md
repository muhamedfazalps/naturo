## Current Version
v0.3.1 (PyPI + GitHub Release)

## Active Work
Query live data — do not rely on this section for specific issue numbers:
```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json milestone,number,title,labels \
  --jq 'group_by(.milestone.title // "backlog") | sort_by(.[0].milestone.title // "z") |
  .[] | "\n### \(.[0].milestone.title // "Backlog")\n\(.[] | "- #\(.number) [\(.labels | map(.name) | join(","))] \(.title)")"'
```

## Milestone Summary (2026-05-31 04:01Z — 8th consecutive frozen-source review, PR #892 silent ~67h post-push / ~54h post v2-request, ~18h to 72h soft deadline)
- **v0.3.2**: **30 open** / 89 closed (75%). Source HEAD `a3541ae` (last source-touching commit `17aefe6`) unchanged across reviews 2026-05-29 AM/Noon/PM and 2026-05-30 0003Z / 0401Z / 0701Z / 1601Z and 2026-05-31 0401Z. QA-Mariana idle since R153 (~36h, correct on frozen source). **PR #892 status: silent ~54h post v2-request.** Author @botbikamordehai2-sketch has 0 comments on the PR; Orc's v2 request comment at 2026-05-28T22:04Z still unanswered. Last author push `51dd440` is 2026-05-28T09:12Z (~67h old). 72h soft deadline = 2026-05-31T22:04Z (**~18h away** — next cycle is the decision cycle). Pre-staged post-deadline plan: (a) post second Orc comment on #892 noting soft deadline reached, opening 48h final window for author response, signaling Dev-Sirius will work #885 in parallel; (b) comment on #885 unblocking Dev-Sirius to resume; (c) do NOT close #892 (RULES.md §1). Ship gate unchanged: close #885 + verify 5 status:done from console session.
- **v0.3.3**: 6 open / 1 closed. Enterprise features. Blocked on v0.3.2.
- **v0.3.4**: **47 open** / 8 closed. New from QA R135–R145: #888–#891, #894–#900. All MCP/CLI contract-drift, JSON envelope drift, parameter-name drift, exit-code drift. #890 (MCP list_snapshots fails 100%) is the only P1; rest P2. v0.3.4 is effectively a "contract stability" milestone — worth considering whether to formalize as the explicit theme (would help focus Dev planning when v0.3.3 ships). Blocked on v0.3.2.
- **Backlog**: 9 open (Linux platform + #777 Unicode capture). Community/docs tasks (#106/#94–#96/etc.) moved into v0.3.4.

## Agent Roster
- **Dev-Sirius**: Technical cofounder. Latest session 2026-04-05 (idle **56 days**). Top priority unchanged: **#885 (P0 epic, Python-only)** — full surface matrix now consolidated in epic comment thread. PR #892 from external contributor exists but is incomplete; if Dev-Sirius works #885 first they should fully replace #892; if community v2 lands first, Dev-Sirius pivots to next queue item. Other unblocked: #870 (P1 test fix), #720, #856, #861, #862 (P2 refactors), #902 (P1 docs — CONTRIBUTING.md branch model). #809 + status:done verification still runner-blocked. **Strategic escalation candidate (2nd cycle flagged)** — manual nudge increasingly warranted; recommend #902 (30-min docs job, no runner needed) as low-cost re-warmup if Ace can poke Dev-Sirius before next cycle.
- **QA-Mariana**: Quality cofounder. **153 rounds completed**. Running on NATUROBOT. 5 status:done still unverified (SendInput-blocked by #863). Idle since R153 (~36h, correct — frozen source). Strong R153 sharpening artifact (TC-0090 end-to-end workflow exit-code consistency) already on #885.
- **Orc-Mycelium**: Strategic orchestrator. Latest session (2026-05-31 04:01Z — 8th cycle on frozen source). Confirmed PR #892 still silent at ~67h post author push / ~54h post Orc v2 review (`UNSTABLE`/MERGEABLE, external fork — checks `action_required`; `no checks reported`). QA idle since R153 (correct). 0 stale `status:in-progress`. No new orphan branches (only develop + main). 5 stars / 6 forks unchanged. No new issues filed since #902 (2026-05-28T22:05Z), no PR/issue comments posted (avoiding nag; 72h soft window has ~18h remaining). RULES.md §13 satisfied by sweep coverage: verified milestone counts (30/6/47/9) match prior state via `--limit 100` queries, #902 (P1 docs fix) still open and unassigned (last updated 2026-05-29T07:04Z — 4 days untouched). Pre-staged decision plan for next cycle (post-deadline action template above). Refreshed STATE.md. Previous session (2026-05-30 1601Z): 7th cycle, ~30h to soft deadline.

## Coordination
- Bug tracking: GitHub Issues only
- State flow: status:in-progress -> status:done -> verified -> close
- CI must be green before any merge
- **SHIP GATE (unchanged from 2026-05-28 PM restructure)**: (1) Close epic #885 (silent-failure cluster — 9-surface matrix consolidated in epic comments). (2) Verify 5 status:done issues (#786, #788, #807, #840, #843) from a console-session QA invocation. #863 remains a v0.3.3 ops task.
- **CI BLOCKER (secondary)**: Self-hosted runner ROBOT-COMPILE offline **day 60** (#842, no update in 21d). Cloud VM alternative (#860) still unassigned day 22. Chronic — needs Ace decision.
- GitHub-hosted `windows-latest` runner confirmed CANNOT substitute (no interactive desktop session)
- **Branch model contradiction**: CONTRIBUTING.md step 5 reads "squash merge to main" — contradicts develop-first rule. Misled PR #892. Filed as #902 (P1).
- All remote branches clean (only develop and main), but PR #892 is **open against `main`** — must be retargeted before merge.
- CI on develop: GREEN (Build & Test + CodeQL pass; last run 2026-05-25)
- Scheduled workflow crons DISABLED on main (PR #858) — re-enable when runner restored

## Code Health
- 150 source files, 222+ test files (QA-Mariana adds reports continuously)
- Large files needing split: `_element.py` (1,517, #720), `browser_cmd.py` (1,378, #856), `macos.py` (1,065, #862), `_input.py` (1,057, #861) — all four still open
- Version consistent: 0.3.1 across pyproject.toml, version.py, PyPI
- **5 stars, 6 forks** on GitHub (+1 fork since last review — likely PR #892 author)
- Silent-failure cluster (#885) systemic gap unchanged on HEAD `17aefe6` per QA R145. Fix should include CI check to prevent recurrence (e.g. lint that flags any entrypoint without a guard or explicit `# desktop-not-required` opt-out).
