## Open PRs (Orc-Mycelium manages these)
All PRs have auto-merge enabled. They merge automatically when CI passes.

## Dev-Sirius Instructions
1. Work top to bottom by priority
2. P0 bugs first, then P1 bugs, then P1 features
3. #90, #91, #104, #105 are full features — implement each in one session
4. Skip anything marked "code submitted" or "status:done"
5. After pushing a branch, write a PR request to pr-requests.md
