## PR Request: fix/issue-776-app-id-promotion
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: promote --app aN to --app-id in window/dialog/desktop commands (fixes #776)
- **Body**: The #752 fix added app ID pattern detection (`--app a1` → `--app-id a1`) to core and interaction commands but missed window_cmd (8 commands), dialog_cmd (5 commands), and desktop_cmd (1 command). Users passing `--app a1` to these commands got silent failure because fuzzy process-name matching was used instead of app ID resolution. Added `maybe_promote_app_to_app_id` call before `resolve_app_id_to_hwnd` in all 14 affected call sites. Tests: 2 new tests verify promotion in window focus and dialog detect. Full suite: 3804 passed, ruff clean.
- **Auto-merge**: yes
- **Date**: 2026-04-01
- **Status**: merged into develop (commit 30c9d53)

## PR Request: docs/issue-774-roadmap-browser-scope
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: docs: update ROADMAP.md with v0.3.1 shipped features and v0.3.2 browser scope (fixes #774)
- **Body**: Added v0.3.1 section documenting the quality sprint (15+ bug fixes), AI vision improvements (model registry, provider CLI params), and input enhancements (mouse trajectories, strategy pattern). Added v0.3.2 section with browser automation scope (9 issues from #758-#766). No code changes.
- **Auto-merge**: yes
- **Date**: 2026-04-01
- **Status**: merged into develop (commit 8c80357)

## PR Request: fix/trajectory-and-registry-quality
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: consistent rounding in trajectory + model registry edge cases
- **Body**: Fixes rounding inconsistencies in trajectory point generation and adds edge case handling to the model registry. Changes: trajectory rounding made consistent (4 lines in _trajectory.py), model registry edge cases handled (8 lines in model_registry.py). Tests: 40 new lines in test_model_registry.py, 46 new lines in test_trajectory.py. All tests pass, ruff clean.
- **Auto-merge**: yes
- **Date**: 2026-04-01
- **Status**: merged into develop (commit f678381)

## PR Request: refactor/config-cmd-deduplicate-credentials
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: refactor: deduplicate credential functions in config_cmd.py
- **Body**: config_cmd.py had private _load_credentials(), _save_credentials(), and _CREDENTIALS_PATH that duplicated the public API in naturo.config. Replaced with imports from naturo.config to ensure consistent behavior (e.g. debug logging on read failure) and reduce maintenance burden. Removed 31 lines of duplicate code. Tests updated to use naturo.config directly. All 25 config_cmd tests pass, ruff clean.
- **Auto-merge**: yes
- **Date**: 2026-04-01
- **Status**: pending (branch recreated and force-pushed 2026-04-01)

## PR Request: docs/issue-721-example-scripts
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: docs: create working example scripts (fixes #721)
- **Body**: Five working example scripts covering core naturo automation patterns: notepad_hello.py (app lifecycle + typing + dialog), window_capture.py (bulk screenshots with JSON parsing), ui_inspector.py (interactive UI tree exploration), form_filler.py (form field filling with Calculator demo), agent_demo.py (AI agent integration via CLI loop, MCP, and AI vision). Updated examples/README.md with usage instructions and common patterns. All scripts are ruff-clean and mypy-clean, Python 3.9+ compatible.
- **Auto-merge**: yes

- **Status**: pending (branch recreated and force-pushed 2026-04-01)

## PR Request: docs/issue-722-mcp-server-reference
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: docs: create dedicated MCP server reference (fixes #722)
- **Body**: Comprehensive reference for all 58 MCP tools across 11 modules (capture, window, UI inspection, input, app control, wait, snapshot, clipboard, dialog, system, Excel). Includes setup instructions for stdio/SSE/HTTP transports, parameter details, common patterns, error handling, and a worked Notepad automation example.
- **Auto-merge**: yes

## PR Request: refactor/issue-719-cli-by-domain
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: refactor: reorganize CLI commands by domain (fixes #719)
- **Body**: Moved system commands (clipboard, dialog, desktop, taskbar, tray) into `cli/system/` subdirectory and value commands (get, set) into `cli/values/`, following the existing pattern established by `cli/core/` and `cli/interaction/`. Renamed `system.py` to `_app_group.py` (it only defines the app Click group stub) and removed 100+ lines of dead code (unused menu, taskbar, tray stubs superseded by dedicated cmd files). All test mock patch paths updated. 4166 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: feat/issue-762-browser-wait-mechanisms
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add browser wait mechanisms — navigation, URL, function, network idle (fixes #762)
- **Body**: Four new BrowserPage methods: wait_for_navigation (URL change + load), wait_for_url (substring/regex match), wait_for_function (JS expression polling), wait_for_network_idle (resource count stabilisation). Four corresponding CLI commands: wait-navigation, wait-url, wait-function, wait-network-idle. Public wait_for_network_idle replaces the private _wait_for_network_idle with a proper implementation using performance.getEntriesByType polling. 11 unit tests covering success and timeout paths. All 4184 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: feat/issue-758-chrome-profiles
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add Chrome profile management — launch, list, delete (fixes #758)
- **Body**: New `_launcher.py` module with Chrome/Chromium auto-discovery across Windows/Mac/Linux, profile-based user-data directories (`~/.config/naturo/browser-profiles/<name>/`), and CDP startup health check. ChromeProcess wrapper for graceful termination. Three new CLI commands: `browser launch` (--profile, --headless, --chrome-path, --extra-args), `browser profiles` (list with size/date), `browser profile-delete` (with --force). 37 new tests, all mocked (no desktop needed). Ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: feat/issue-760-anti-detection
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add anti-detection defaults — stealth flags and JS patches (fixes #760)
- **Body**: New `_stealth.py` module with Chrome launch flags (disable AutomationControlled, infobars, extensions, realistic window size) and 6 runtime JS patches (navigator.webdriver, plugins, languages, permissions, chrome.runtime, WebGL vendor). Patches registered via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` for persistence across navigations. Two CLI commands: `browser stealth` (apply to running browser), `browser stealth-flags` (print flags for manual launch). 18 new tests, all mocked. Ruff clean, mypy clean.
- **Auto-merge**: yes
- **Date**: 2026-04-02
- **Status**: pending (branch re-created and force-pushed 2026-04-02)

## PR Request: feat/issue-764-iframe-support
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add iframe support — frame listing, context switching (fixes #764)
- **Body**: BrowserPage gains `frames()` and `frame(selector)` methods for navigating iframe hierarchies. Frame context uses `Page.createIsolatedWorld` so `evaluate`/`find`/`find_all` execute inside the target iframe. Supports nested frames with URL matching. One CLI command: `browser frames` (list all frames). 17 new tests, all mocked. Ruff clean, mypy clean.
- **Auto-merge**: yes

- **Status**: pending (branch re-created and force-pushed 2026-04-02)

## PR Request: feat/issue-765-network-interception
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add network request interception — monitor, intercept, mock (fixes #765)
- **Body**: New `_network.py` module with `NetworkMonitor` class wrapping CDP Network domain. Features: `capture_snapshot` (performance API), `find_requests` (glob filtering), `intercept` (abort/fulfill), `abort_pattern`/`mock_response` shorthands, JS-based injection. `BrowserPage.network` property for lazy access. Two CLI commands: `browser requests` (list with filters) and `browser intercept` (add rules). 20 unit tests, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: feat/issue-761-captcha-handling
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: feat: add captcha handling architecture — detect, solve, inject (fixes #761)
- **Body**: Pluggable captcha solver pattern with `CaptchaManager`, `CaptchaSolver` ABC, and two built-in solvers: `ManualSolver` (polls for user solution) and `TokenInjectionSolver` (injects pre-obtained tokens from external services). Detection via JS covers reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, and generic iframe captchas. Two CLI commands: `browser captcha-detect` and `browser captcha-solve` (--solver manual|token:TOKEN). 37 unit tests, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: fix/issue-785-uwp-launch-pid
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: resolve real app PID after Windows cmd /c start launch (fixes #785)
- **Body**: On Windows, `launch_app` used `cmd /c start` which returns cmd.exe's PID, not the actual application PID. For UWP apps like Calculator, the real process runs under a completely different PID. Now waits for cmd.exe to exit, then polls `find_process` to locate the actual app process by name/alias. Falls back to cmd.exe PID if the process isn't found within 3 seconds (or the full timeout if `--wait-until-ready`). 5 new tests covering PID resolution, alias fallback, wait-until-ready, and timeout. All 94 process tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: fix/issue-784-type-newline-drop
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: send Enter/Tab for control chars in keystroke simulation (fixes #784)
- **Body**: `naturo_key_type()` and `naturo_phys_key_type()` in `core/src/input.cpp` sent `\n`, `\r`, and `\t` characters as `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` events which Windows silently dropped. Now detects these control characters and sends `VK_RETURN` / `VK_TAB` virtual-key (or scan code for hardware mode) events instead. Both normal and hardware input modes are fixed. Needs desktop CI verification.
- **Auto-merge**: yes

## PR Request: feat/issue-723-cost-guardrails
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: ops: add cost guardrails for scheduled agents (fixes #723)
- **Body**: Daily run limit (default 20/day) checked via GitHub API before each QA-Mariana session. Global pause_all switch for emergency shutdown. Config in agents/config/cost-guardrails.yaml with per-agent budgets for QA-Mariana and Dev-Sirius. 11 new tests validate config structure. 4177 tests pass, ruff clean.

## PR Request: test/browser-cmd-coverage
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: test: add 56 tests for browser CLI subcommands
- **Body**: Covers all 16 browser commands (navigate, find, click, type, text, attr, html, screenshot, eval, url, title, wait, tabs, tab, scroll, hover, close) plus group options and connection error handling. All tests use mocked BrowserPage — no Chrome required. 4222 tests pass, ruff clean.

## PR Request: fix/issue-776-app-id-promotion (round 2)
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: resolve app IDs (a1, a2, …) in all app subcommands (fixes #776)
- **Body**: The first round fixed window/dialog/desktop commands but missed the 14 app subcommands: launch, quit, relaunch, find, inspect, hide, unhide, switch, focus, close, minimize, maximize, restore, move. Added `_resolve_app_id_name()` helper that detects the `a<N>` pattern and resolves via the session app ID map. Process-based commands (quit, find, inspect) get PID; window-based commands (focus, close, minimize, etc.) get HWND. Expired/unknown IDs produce clear error messages in both text and JSON modes. 9 new tests covering resolution, expiry, JSON error, and normal-name passthrough. All 3899 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

Added `_resolve_app_id()` helper that detects the `a<N>` pattern and resolves via the session app ID map. Process-based commands (quit, find, inspect) get PID; window-based commands (focus, close, minimize, etc.) get HWND. Expired/unknown IDs produce clear error messages in both text and JSON modes. 15 new tests covering resolution, expiry, JSON error, and normal-name passthrough. All 116 app_cmd tests pass, 3814 total pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: test/browser-page-element-coverage
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: test: add 76 tests for BrowserPage and BrowserElement (CDP mocked)
- **Body**: Fills the last major test coverage gap in the browser package. BrowserPage tests (44) cover construction, connection errors, properties, navigation, element finding, wait_for states, screenshot, evaluate, tabs, scrolling, lifecycle, and internal event waiting. BrowserElement tests (32) cover properties, attributes, click/hover/type interactions, scroll_into_view, child finding (CSS/XPath), bounding-rect calculation, and repr. All tests use mocked CDPClient — no Chrome required. 4242 tests pass, ruff clean.

## PR Request: fix/issue-788-stale-pid-hwnd
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: detect stale PID/HWND after app restart, fall back to process name (fixes #788)
- **Body**: After an app restarts, cached app-ID entries (HWND + PID) become stale. Returning them caused focus_window/SendInput to silently drop keystrokes. Two-layer fix: (1) _resolve_app_id validates PID liveness via OpenProcess/kill(0); when dead, extracts process-name basename for live window enumeration. (2) _resolve_hwnd validates HWND with IsWindow(); raises WindowNotFoundError or falls through to PID/name resolution. 6 new tests (PID alive/dead, path stripping, HWND validation). Existing tests updated to mock _is_pid_alive. 4334 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.

## PR Request: fix/issue-789-app-filter-basename
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: fix: extract process basename before --app matching (fixes #789)
- **Body**: process_name from the C++ bridge includes the full executable path (e.g. C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe). The --app filter did substring matching against the full path, so `--app system` would incorrectly match any process in System32. Now uses ntpath.basename() to extract just the filename before matching in _resolve_hwnd, _resolve_hwnds, and _afh_has_content_window. 6 new tests covering path components, basename exact/substring, and _resolve_hwnds. 4334 tests pass, ruff clean, mypy clean.
