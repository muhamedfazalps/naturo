# NEEDS-ACE — Human-Decision Queue

> The autonomous naturo loop (Dev / QA / Orch) runs unattended and self-closes everything it can.
> This file is the short list of things **only Ace can decide**. Refreshed by the Orchestrator each
> review cycle. Read this first on a check-in. Each item also has a GitHub issue labelled `needs:ace`.

_Last refreshed: 2026-06-17 15:24 (Orc autonomous cycle — **v0.3.2 SHIP-GATE FULLY MET — release is your
call (#914)**; otherwise quiet/healthy. Since the 14:22 cycle: team Dev opened PR **#966**
(`fix/issue-964-cli-window-loud-failure` → `develop`, fixes #964 — CLI `get`/`set --window <unmatched>`
must fail loudly with `WINDOW_NOT_FOUND`, not silently foreground) with auto-merge SQUASH enabled and it
**MERGED mid-cycle** (`64080d0`). Orc did the post-merge handoff (**#964 → `status:done`**, awaiting QA;
base ≠ default branch so no auto-close) and confirmed the branch is **deleted** (Rule 14). **No open PRs;
#964 is the sole `status:done` item.** Orc also triaged two unmilestoned actionable bugs into **v0.3.4**: **#916** (P2 from:qa — taskbar/tray list returns
empty `success:true`, silent-failure class) and **#917** (P1 from:orc — runner watchdog, code-only). Live
needs:ace queue **#935/#915/#914/#860/#842** unchanged (no new human-only item); **#915** safe to close
(loop healthy). `develop` CI **green** on HEAD `4d19823` (Build & Test + CodeQL success). Weekly
competitiveness step not due (<7d since 06-16 baseline)._

## Open decisions
| # | Decision | Why it's yours | Orc recommendation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| [#914](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/914) | **v0.3.2 ship-gate sign-off** | release / tag to `main` = PyPI publish | **READY TO CUT — this is now the top actionable item.** Both ship-gate requirements are met: req (1) (epic #885 cluster) verified+closed; req (2) **all 5 status:done bugs verified+closed** (#786/#788/#807/#840 @01:15Z + #843 @02:42Z). `develop` CI green on `d3cfe92`. **Cutting / tagging v0.3.2 (tag→main = PyPI publish) is your call — the loop cannot and will not do it (Rule 2).** |
| [#935](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/935) | Two Dev cycles ran **concurrently in the shared `naturo-dev` worktree** — the 2nd cycle's Step 0 `reset --hard` wiped the 1st's in-flight uncommitted branch (#910). **Rule 4 violation at the orchestration layer.** | orchestration / scheduling policy (runner.ps1 / cron / lock) | Add a **per-worktree lock** in `naturo-loop-locks\` that a starting `runner:dev` must acquire (skip the round if held), and/or serialize dev so two cycles never share one tree. Self-fixing is unsafe — concurrent git ops would corrupt the peer cycle. |
| [#842](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/842) / [#860](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/860) | Desktop CI: self-hosted runner ROBOT-COMPILE offline (#842) vs fund a cloud Windows VM (#860) | infra spend | Decide: revive the runner, fund a cloud Windows VM, or accept GitHub-hosted-only CI. (No longer needed for input verification — see #863 below — but still the only path to desktop-marked CI jobs.) |

## Recommended for closure (Orc cannot close needs:ace/QA items unattended — your confirm)
| # | What changed | Orc recommendation |
|---|--------------|--------------------|
| [#915](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/915) | "QA loop down ~5 days / 403". **Fully recovered.** QA has run **many** clean rounds since the proxy auto-detect fix (`2ccbcf0`) — 16:43/17:42/18:50/20:45/21:40/22:40 on 06-16, then 00:45Z and a full **real-input ship-gate verification round at 01:15Z** that closed 4 P0/P1 bugs. The 403 era is over. | **Close #915.** Durability is demonstrated across a day+ of rounds incl. live input. |
| [#863](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/863) | "SendInput blocked in agent session — runtime verification impossible." **Premise disproven.** QA's 01:15Z probe-first gate (launch throwaway notepad → `type "QA_PROBE"` → confirm window title) showed **input works on this no-RDP console** and verified all 4 input-family bugs end-to-end. Capability landed in `19a72cd`. | **QA to close #863** (it owns the `from:qa` issue). No human input-session provisioning is needed. Orc left it for QA rather than closing cross-domain. |

_Resolved earlier: **#913** (dispose community PRs #892 / #904) — closed 2026-06-16; both community PRs closed._

## Ship-gate status — v0.3.2  →  **FULLY MET (release is Ace's call, #914)**
- (1) Epic **#885** (silent-failure cluster): **CLOSED + verified 2026-06-16** (with #868/#875/#878/#883/#893).
  **Requirement (1) MET.**
- (2) QA-verify the 5 `status:done` bugs on a real desktop: **#786, #788, #807, #840** → **VERIFIED + CLOSED
  2026-06-17 01:15Z**; **#843** → **VERIFIED + CLOSED 2026-06-17 02:42Z** (runtime composite check confirms
  the #948 Z-order fix; `test_capture_popup_843.py` 12/12). **Requirement (2) MET — `status:done` ship-gate
  queue empty.**
- **Both requirements satisfied. The only remaining action is cutting / tagging the release (#914) —
  human-only (Rule 2); the loop will not tag `main`.**

## Blocks
- **None blocking the ship-gate.** #843 (capture popup compositing) **verified+closed 2026-06-17 02:42Z** —
  the last v0.3.2 ship-gate item is cleared. v0.3.2 awaits only Ace's release sign-off (#914).
- `develop` CI: **green** (Build & Test + CodeQL success on HEAD `792c46c`).
- Desktop CI runner **#842** offline (chronic; infra decision above).
- _Cleared this cycle:_ **#863** (input verification — proven possible) and **#915** (QA auth — recovered)
  are no longer blocks; both recommended for closure above.
- _Related (not a human decision):_ [#917](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/917) (P1,
  `silent-failure`) — `runner.ps1` still has no failure-streak watchdog. Code-only for Dev.

_How this works: anything irreversible or human-only is queued here instead of acted on. Everything else
the loop does itself — opens PRs, merges green ones to develop, verifies on the real desktop, closes issues,
files new work. See `agents/local/README.md`._
