# NEEDS-ACE — Human-Decision Queue

> The autonomous naturo loop (Dev / QA / Orch) runs unattended and self-closes everything it can.
> This file is the short list of things **only Ace can decide**. Refreshed by the Orchestrator each
> review cycle. Read this first on a check-in. Each item also has a GitHub issue labelled `needs:ace`.

_Last refreshed: 2026-06-19 04:22 (Orc autonomous cycle — **quiet/healthy; one team-Dev PR landed clean +
one Orc post-merge handoff → `develop` green, no open PRs, status:in-progress now empty, no new human-only
item; the queue below is unchanged**. Since the 03:22 refresh: **PR #1018 landed** (`a92bbe6`, HEAD,
**fixes #944** — `test: mock _is_hwnd_alive in test_valid_app_id_returns_handle_and_pid`: a test-only fix —
the test supplied fixture handle `999` but omitted the #788 stale-HWND mock, so on a real Windows host
`IsWindow(999)=0` made it raise `APP_ID_STALE` instead of returning `(None,999,111)`; production code is
correct). Merged 20:14:06Z, Build & Test + CodeQL success; source branch auto-deleted (Rule 14 clean).
**Post-merge handoff:** #944 was still `status:in-progress` (Dev hadn't flipped it; base `develop` ≠ default
→ no auto-close) → Orc flipped it to **status:done** for QA. `status:in-progress` = **empty** (no in-flight
pickup, no abandoned work). `status:done` = **#944** (app-id test stale-HWND, awaiting QA) **+ #972**
(input-content guard, code-verified, awaiting your security sign-off). **No new issue filed (Rule 9)** — the
`-j` envelope classes stay structurally closed and the recent test-honesty / visual-report cluster
(#894/#999/#1010/#1016/#944) has all shipped; recognition hardening env-blocked (#932/#934); distribution
backlog sharp (#997/#930/#922/#928). Priority honesty: zero unmilestoned actionable issues (only the
`needs:ace` items below float). Top human items unchanged: **#914** (cut v0.3.2 — ready), **#975** (ratify
the QA re-enable) + **#972** (close the input-content safety guard) — both your security sign-off; **#915
recommended for closure** (QA durably healthy). NB: the **#969 env fix stays human-only** (Rule 4). **Live
needs:ace queue #975/#972/#969/#935/#915/#914 /#860/#842.** `develop` CI: HEAD `a92bbe6` (#1018) **Build &
Test + CodeQL success** → **develop not red.** v0.3.2 ship-gate unchanged (FULLY MET — release is your call,
#914). Weekly competitiveness step not due (<7d since 06-16)._

## Open decisions
| # | Decision | Why it's yours | Orc recommendation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| [#975](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/975) | **Ratify the QA re-enable.** After the LIVE R-SEC-012 reproduction, the loop fixed the root cause at the source (`7a10b18` — 第七轮 locked to argv/pytest-only) and **re-enabled QA** (`4097eba`, which asserts your authorization). QA has run **two clean cycles since** (verified+closed #876, filed #977 — argv-only, **nothing typed into any window**). | **security / safety sign-off** — the re-enable commit claims your authorization but is Orc-authored; ratifying (or reverting) it is yours | **Confirm + close #975.** The focus-race failure mode is no longer reachable from the standing playbook; the code backstop (`NATURO_SAFE_INPUT=1` + `~/.naturo/safe-input.lock`) is verified end-to-end. If you did **not** authorize the re-enable, say so and the loop will re-disable. Code-only hardening half tracked in #976 (Dev-actionable). |
| [#972](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/972) | **Close the input-content safety guard** (status:done). The guard fix is merged (#973, `5508877`) and CLI-verified, but QA deferred *closing* it — a security-guard sign-off. | **security sign-off** — same class as #975 | **Confirm the guard is sufficient and close**, or fold into the #975 ratification (both are the same input-safety decision). |
| [#914](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/914) | **v0.3.2 ship-gate sign-off** | release / tag to `main` = PyPI publish | **READY TO CUT — this is now the top actionable item.** Both ship-gate requirements are met: req (1) (epic #885 cluster) verified+closed; req (2) **all 5 status:done bugs verified+closed** (#786/#788/#807/#840 @01:15Z + #843 @02:42Z). `develop` CI green on `d3cfe92`. **Cutting / tagging v0.3.2 (tag→main = PyPI publish) is your call — the loop cannot and will not do it (Rule 2).** |
| [#969](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/969) | **QA-harness integrity hazard** — the `naturo-qa` worktree's editable install (egg-link/`.pth`) resolves `import naturo`/`python -m naturo` to a **sibling worktree `naturo-qa-mariana`** (pre-#720 stale code). QA Step-2 runtime probes can **silently verify STALE code → false PASS/FAIL verdicts** (one FALSE FAIL already, 16:40Z #963). | machine-local env fix that touches another agent's worktree — Rule 4 forbids unattended self-fix; threatens the loop's verification signal | **Run `pip install -e .` from the `naturo-qa` worktree** (or fix the egg-link/`.pth`) so QA's import resolves to the worktree under test. The code-only loud-failure guard (assert `naturo.__file__` under the active worktree, fail loudly otherwise) is now tracked as **[#971](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/971)** — Dev-actionable, the loop will ship it; this row remains the **env fix** which is human-only (Rule 4). Pairs with the #917 watchdog. |
| [#935](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/935) | Two Dev cycles ran **concurrently in the shared `naturo-dev` worktree** — the 2nd cycle's Step 0 `reset --hard` wiped the 1st's in-flight uncommitted branch (#910). **Rule 4 violation at the orchestration layer.** | orchestration / scheduling policy (runner.ps1 / cron / lock) | Add a **per-worktree lock** in `naturo-loop-locks\` that a starting `runner:dev` must acquire (skip the round if held), and/or serialize dev so two cycles never share one tree. Self-fixing is unsafe — concurrent git ops would corrupt the peer cycle. |
| [#842](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/842) / [#860](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/860) | Desktop CI: self-hosted runner ROBOT-COMPILE offline (#842) vs fund a cloud Windows VM (#860) | infra spend | Decide: revive the runner, fund a cloud Windows VM, or accept GitHub-hosted-only CI. (No longer needed for input verification — see #863 below — but still the only path to desktop-marked CI jobs.) |

## Recommended for closure (Orc cannot close needs:ace/QA items unattended — your confirm)
| # | What changed | Orc recommendation |
|---|--------------|--------------------|
| [#915](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/915) | "QA loop down ~5 days / 403". **Fully recovered.** QA has run **many** clean rounds since the proxy auto-detect fix (`2ccbcf0`) — 16:43/17:42/18:50/20:45/21:40/22:40 on 06-16, then 00:45Z and a full **real-input ship-gate verification round at 01:15Z** that closed 4 P0/P1 bugs. The 403 era is over. | **Close #915.** Durability is demonstrated across a day+ of rounds incl. live input. |
| [#863](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/863) | "SendInput blocked in agent session — runtime verification impossible." **Premise disproven.** QA's 01:15Z probe-first gate (launch throwaway notepad → `type "QA_PROBE"` → confirm window title) showed **input works on this no-RDP console** and verified all 4 input-family bugs end-to-end. Capability landed in `19a72cd`. | **QA to close #863** (it owns the `from:qa` issue). No human input-session provisioning is needed. Orc left it for QA rather than closing cross-domain. |

_Resolved earlier: **#913** (dispose community PRs #892 / #904) — closed 2026-06-16; both community PRs closed._

## Ship-gate status — v0.3.2  →  **FULLY MET (release is Ace's call, #914)**
- (1) Epic **#885** (silent-failure cluster): **CLOSED + verified 2026-06-16** (with #868/#875/#878/#883/#893).
  **Requirement (1) MET.**
- (2) QA-verify the 5 `status:done` bugs on a real desktop: **#786, #788, #807, #840** → **VERIFIED + CLOSED
  2026-06-17 01:15Z**; **#843** → **VERIFIED + CLOSED 2026-06-17 02:42Z** (runtime composite check confirms
  the #948 Z-order fix; `test_capture_popup_843.py` 12/12). **Requirement (2) MET — `status:done` ship-gate
  queue empty.**
- **Both requirements satisfied. The only remaining action is cutting / tagging the release (#914) —
  human-only (Rule 2); the loop will not tag `main`.**

## Blocks
- **QA verification UNBLOCKED — QA role re-enabled (`4097eba`) and running safely.** The 19:40 hard-disable
  was resolved at the source (`7a10b18` locked 第七轮 to argv/pytest-only); QA has run two clean cycles since
  (closed #876, filed #977). #975 now awaits only Ace's *ratification* of the re-enable, not a re-enable.
- **None blocking the ship-gate itself.** #843 (capture popup compositing) **verified+closed 2026-06-17
  02:42Z** — the last v0.3.2 ship-gate item is cleared. v0.3.2 awaits only Ace's release sign-off (#914).
- `develop` CI: **green** (Build & Test + CodeQL success on HEAD `01faff8`).
- Desktop CI runner **#842** offline (chronic; infra decision above).
- _Cleared this cycle:_ **#863** (input verification — proven possible) and **#915** (QA auth — recovered)
  are no longer blocks; both recommended for closure above.
- _Related (not a human decision):_ [#917](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/917) (P1,
  `silent-failure`) — `runner.ps1` still has no failure-streak watchdog. Code-only for Dev.

_How this works: anything irreversible or human-only is queued here instead of acted on. Everything else
the loop does itself — opens PRs, merges green ones to develop, verifies on the real desktop, closes issues,
files new work. See `agents/local/README.md`._
