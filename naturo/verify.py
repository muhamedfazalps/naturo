"""Post-action verification engine for interaction commands.

Detects silent failures by checking whether an action actually had effect.
This is the core of issue #231 — naturo must never lie about success.

Each verification strategy checks the UI state after an action and returns
a VerificationResult indicating whether the action's effect was confirmed.

Design principle: **false negatives are acceptable, false positives are not.**
If verification cannot determine outcome, report ``verified=None`` (unknown)
rather than ``verified=True``.
