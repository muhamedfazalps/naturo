        Matching strategy (BUG-069/BUG-070):

        When ``app`` is provided, matches against **process name and aliases
        only** (``.exe`` suffix stripped).  Title matching is not used for
        ``--app`` to prevent cross-process contamination (#465).  When
        ``window_title`` is provided, matches against window title only.

        When ``pid`` is provided (alone or combined with app/window_title),
        only windows belonging to that process are considered (#471).  Among
        matching PID windows, the largest-area window in the interactive
        session is preferred.

        Scoring for ``--app`` (higher = better match):
          4 — exact process-name match  (e.g. ``explorer`` == ``explorer.exe``)
          3 — process-name substring    (e.g. ``expl`` in ``explorer.exe``)
        Alias matches (e.g. ``calculator`` → ``calculatorapp``) use the same
        scores as direct process-name matches.

        Session awareness (#230): When multiple windows match with equal
        scores, windows in the active console session are strongly preferred
        over windows in Session 0 (the non-interactive services session).
        This prevents schtasks/remote contexts from targeting ghost windows.

        Foreground preference (#449): When multiple windows match with equal
        scores and session status, the foreground (focused) window is
        preferred.  This ensures consecutive commands (``type`` then
        ``capture``) target the same window deterministically.

        Case-insensitive throughout.  Among equal scores the window with
        the largest area wins (#440: popup menus are tiny top-level windows
        that should not beat the main application window).

            app: Application/process name to search for (case-insensitive,

                match).  Compared against window title only.
