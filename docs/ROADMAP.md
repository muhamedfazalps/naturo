### Dialog & System
- [x] Dialog detection and interaction (accept/dismiss/fill)
- [x] Taskbar interaction (list/click)
- [x] System tray (list/click)

> Note: `clipboard` and `open` CLI commands removed in v0.2.0.
> These are handled directly by the orchestrating AI agent.

### Deep Capabilities
- [x] Multi-monitor capture
- [x] DPI/scaling awareness (125%/150%/200%)
- [x] Virtual desktop support
- [x] MSAA / IAccessible
- [x] IAccessible2 (Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice)
- [x] Java Access Bridge (Swing/AWT)

- [x] UIA cache optimization (CacheRequest, batch properties)
> Note: Chrome CDP, Electron, Registry, and Service CLI commands removed in v0.2.0.
> Backend modules kept for Unified App Model internal use.
> Use PowerShell for registry/service ops, Playwright for browser automation.
- [x] Process management (launch/quit/relaunch/find)
- [x] UI tree diff

### macOS Backend
- [x] Peekaboo CLI detection + subprocess wrapper
- [x] capture/list/see via Peekaboo
- [x] click/type/press/hotkey via Peekaboo
- [x] app/window/menu via Peekaboo
- [x] dock/space mapping
- [x] CI: macOS runner integration tests
- [x] Fallback: pyobjc for Peekaboo-free environments

## 0.2.0 ✅ — Eyes + Hands Focus (Breaking)

Refocused on core "Eyes + Hands" for AI agents. Removed 12 non-core CLI commands.

### Removed Commands
- `describe` — AI vision analysis (agent does this)
- `agent` — Natural language automation (OpenClaw handles this)
- `learn` — Tutorial content (moved to docs)
- `record` — High-level orchestration (agent composes commands)
- `chrome` — Browser automation (use Playwright/browser tools)
- `registry` — Windows registry ops (use PowerShell)
- `service` — Windows service ops (use PowerShell)
- `clipboard` — Agent can do this directly
- `open` — Agent can do this directly
- `electron` — Folded into Unified App Model auto-detection
- `structure` — Unclear function
- `paste` — Merged into `type --paste` flag

### Kept Commands (Core Eyes + Hands)
see, find, capture, list, wait, diff, menu-inspect, click, type, press, hotkey, scroll, drag, move, window, app, dialog, taskbar, tray, desktop, mcp, snapshot

### Migration
- `naturo paste "text"` → `naturo type --paste "text"`
- `naturo clipboard get` → Use agent's native clipboard access
- `naturo open <url>` → Use agent's browser tool or system commands
- `naturo chrome ...` → Use Playwright or browser automation skill

## 0.3.0 ✅ — Unified App Model + Selector Foundation

Auto-detect application frameworks and route interactions through the optimal channel. Users don't need to know if it's Electron, Java, or WPF.

See [design doc](design/UNIFIED_APP_MODEL.md).

- [x] Framework detection chain (CDP → UIA → MSAA → JAB → IA2 → Vision)
- [x] `naturo app inspect` — probe app and report available interaction methods
- [x] `naturo app inspect --all` — scan all visible windows
- [x] Per-PID detection cache with TTL
- [x] Auto-routing for action commands (click/type/press/find)
- [x] `--method` override flag for explicit channel selection
- [x] `--quick` mode for fast probe (skip slow checks)
- [x] MCP tools for app inspect
- [x] Integration tests across framework types
- [x] Element ref caching system (temporary eN → coordinates cache with TTL)
- [x] Unified Selector format specification ([design doc](design/UNIFIED_SELECTOR.md))
- [x] Post-action verification engine (`--verify/--no-verify` on type/click/press, #231)
